# EA Foods - Pre-Order System (Flutter Assignment)

## Overview
This project simulates a Pre-Order System where customers place next-day delivery orders based on available stock.

## Key Features
- Orders must be placed in advance.
- Stock-driven orders (cannot exceed inventory).
- Delivery slots: Morning (8-11), Afternoon (12-3), Evening (4-7).
- Cut-off time: 6:00 PM (after cut-off -> +2 days).
- Ops managers update stock twice daily (08:00 AM & 06:00 PM).
- Cancel order restores stock.

## Setup & Run Instructions
1. Clone repo
2. Run: `flutter pub get`
3. Run: `flutter run`




### Assumptions
- Local device clock for cut-off.
- Stock deducted on order, restored on cancel.
- Ops updates at 8AM & 6PM.

### Trade-offs
- Hive instead of real backend.


## Future Improvements
- Slot capacity limits.
- Multi-user roles.


## Example Scenarios
- Order within stock -> Success
- Order exceeding stock -> Rejected
- Order after 6PM -> +2 days
- Cancel order -> Stock restored
- Ops updates stock -> Reflected
