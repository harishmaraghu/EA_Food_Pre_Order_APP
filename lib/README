##EA Foods - Pre-Order System (Flutter Assignment)
Overview
This project simulates a Pre-Order System where customers place next-day delivery orders based on
available stock.
# Key Features:
- Orders must be placed in advance.
- Stock-driven orders (cannot exceed inventory).
- Delivery slots: Morning (8-11), Afternoon (12-3), Evening (4-7).
- Cut-off time: 6:00 PM (after cut-off -> +2 days).
- Ops managers update stock twice daily (08:00 AM & 06:00 PM).
- Cancel order restores stock.
 # Setup & Run Instructions
1. Clone repo
2. Run: flutter pub get
3. Run: flutter run
4. Seed DB with 5-10 products in SQLite/JSON.
 # Design Notes
 #  Assumptions:
- Local device clock for cut-off.
- Stock deducted on order, restored on cancel.
- Ops updates at 8AM & 6PM.
 # Trade-offs:
- SQLite/JSON instead of real backend.
- Bloc used for predictable state management.
 # Future Improvements:
- Slot capacity limits.
- Pagination & caching.
- Notifications for cut-off reminders.
- Multi-user roles.
- Backend API integration.
 # Example Scenarios
- Order within stock -> Success
- Order exceeding stock -> Rejected
- Order after 6PM -> +2 days
- Cancel order -> Stock restored
- Ops updates stock -> Reflected
